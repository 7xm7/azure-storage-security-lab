# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Storage Security & Access Management Lab

## üéØ Objective
This lab demonstrates how to **secure data in Azure Storage** using private access, network isolation, RBAC, and temporary shared access.  
The goal is to build a **storage environment with restricted access and controlled sharing**, following cloud security best practices.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
**Resource Group:** `Lab2-StorageRG`  
**Region:** `West Europe`  
**Main Resources:**
- Azure Storage Account (`lab2xavierstorage`)
- Blob Container (`lab2-blob`)
- File Share (`lab2-share`)
- Virtual Network (`Lab2-VNet`)
- Private Endpoint
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ SAS Token
Generated a temporary SAS URL for controlled external access.  
*(token partially hidden for security)*

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ File Share
File share created to simulate internal file access across the network.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Private Endpoint
Private endpoint configured ‚Äî storage now accessible only through `Lab2-VNet`.
