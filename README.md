# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Storage Security & Access Management Lab

## üéØ Objective
This lab demonstrates how to **secure data in Azure Storage** using private access, network isolation, RBAC, and temporary shared access.  
The goal is to build a **storage environment with restricted access and controlled sharing**, following cloud security best practices.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
**Resource Group:** `Lab2-StorageRG`  
**Region:** `West Europe`  
**Main Resources:**
- Azure Storage Account (`lab2xavierstorage`)
- Blob Container (`lab2-blob`)
- File Share (`lab2-share`)
- Virtual Network (`Lab2-VNet`)
- Private Endpoint
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Private Endpoint
Private endpoint configured. Storage now accessible only through `Lab2-VNet`.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC applied using the **Reader** role for fine grained access management.
